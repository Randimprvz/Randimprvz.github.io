	  <h1>Dev Tools Adventure</h1>
	  <p>I would like to add regex to control f in my firefox browser, is it possible? We will see. I'm quickly learning how impractical it is to modify source of these programs.<br><br>
	  Often times the mod itself is insignificant compared to the lines of code that have to be pored through. However, I can make a plugin.<br><br>
	  I need to find out how to handle keyboard input from the browser, using a firefox extension.</p>
