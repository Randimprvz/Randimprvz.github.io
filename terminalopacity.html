	  <h1>Explorations in Gnome</h1>
	  <p>Let's add opacity to gnome text<br><br>After a fair detour i've just learned that opacity isnt real and my mind is blown.<br><br>
	     What I mean by this is that the background image you see behind your text, is not continuous with the the rest of the background image but is in fact
	     retroactively created.<br><br> For example, black text on a white background will produce gray. But lighten that image enough and you will begin to see
	     the white underneath. However what you are actually seeing is just your letters, there is no 'light shining through' so to speak.<br><br>In effect opacity is functioning 
	     as a map from opacity percentages to certain mixture ratios between the background and foreground image.<br><br><br>
	     Now it's time to learn a little bit about how computers display colors. I ended up not doing this at all and merely digging around in the
	     gnome terminal source. The criterion for whether implementing opacity was viable was whether or not the data structures used to render text included an alpha channel.<br><br>
	     In tech speak, an alpha channel is a fancy name for opacity.<br><br>I found that the text indeed did use an alpha channel but had hardcoded the opacity to 1 and omitted it as an argument.<br><br> There was just one problem though, which is that I think software should be plug and play, and the only way to do that
	     in a sane manner is in process alteration.<br><br> There are better debuggers than gdb but gdb is standard on linux, so I will use that.<br><br>
	     Attaching gdb to gnome terminal just results in a freeze, perhaps becathe entire gui is using gnome? I had noticed that running multiple shells did not result in multiple gnome terminal processes, so perhaps I'm trying to debug the very process I'm using to interact with the gui.<br><br>I realized I knew very little of the GUI stack on linux and some of the workings of X.<br><br>However I had learned that the X session manager communicates with the window manager and opted to explore it on my system.<br><br>Perhaps this could illuminate why gnome needed to be debugged with a separate login session.<br><br></p>
