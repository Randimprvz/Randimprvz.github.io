	  <h1>This text should be larger</h1>
	  <p>Let's add opacity to gnome text<br><br>After a fair detour i've just learned that opacity isnt real and my mind is blown.<br><br>
	     Now it's time to learn a little bit about how computers display colors. I ended up not doing this at all and merely digging around in the
	     gnome terminal source.<br><br> There was just one problem though, which is that I think software should be plug and play, and the only way to do that
	     in a sane manner is in process alteration.<br><br> There are better debuggers than gdb but gdb is standard on linux, so I will use that.<br><br>
	     Attaching gdb to gnome terminal just results in a freeze, perhaps becathe entire gui is using gnome? I had noticed that running multiple shells did not result in multiple gnome terminal processes, so perhaps I'm trying to debug the very process I'm using to interact with the gui.<br><br>I realized I knew very little of the GUI stack on linux and some of the workings of X.<br><br>However I had learned that the X session manager communicates with the window manager and opted to explore it on my system.<br><br>Perhaps this could illuminate why gnome needed to be debugged with a separate login session.<br><br></p>
