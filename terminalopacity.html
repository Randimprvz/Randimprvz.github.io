	  This text should be larger
	  <p>Let's add opacity to gnome text<br><br>After a fair detour i've just learned that opacity isnt real and my mind is blown.<br>
	     Now it's time to learn a little bit about how computers display colors. I ended up not doing this at all and merely digging around in the
	     gnome terminal source. There was just one problem though, which is that I think software should be plug and play, and the only way to do that
	     in a sane manner is in process alteration. There are better debuggers than gdb but gdb is standard on linux, so I will use that.<br><br>
	  Attaching gdb to gnome terminal just results in a freeze, perhaps becathe entire gui is using gnome? I had noticed that running multiple shells did not result in multiple gnome terminal processes, so perhaps I'm trying to debug the very process I'm using to interact with the gui.</p>
